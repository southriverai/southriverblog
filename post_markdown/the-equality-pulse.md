# The equality pulse

In 2025 the world emitted about 43 billion tons of CO2. Although this is the largest annual tonnage in human history there are many reasons, from the falling prices in solar to decreasing abundance of fossil fuels, to expect this number to go down soon, perhaps all the way to zero. Nate Hagens refers to this surge of fossil fuel usage and its impending collapse as the “carbon pulse”. The release of these massive amounts of energy stored beneath the surface over a period of millions of years was instrumental in kickstarted the modern world.

The need to direct all of this fossil fuel energy productively brought along a surge of a different kind however. The foundations of the *equality pulse* can be found in the beginning of the 20th century. With access to vast amounts of motive power societies suddenly found themselves in great demand for autonomous highly educated individuals to direct it. Warfare, logistics and energy production were all bounded by the ability of economies to mobilize highly skilled individuals to organize them. For a time it was impossible to win a global war or run a cold war economy without the employment of a vast spreadsheet class of employees. An army of people that were able to consistently turn pen and paper into mobilization.

In term these people extracted far more political and economic equality from their societies. Between 1900 and 2000 the richest 10% of developed economies transferred almost half of their portion of wealth and income to the rest of the richest half of society, a group now often described as *the middle class*. Freed from living from paycheck to paycheck they organized and forced political concessions such as universal suffrage, pensions and labor protections.

Since the 1990s this development has begun to reverse. As various types of computer technology reduced demand organizing labor these bargaining powers have started to evaporate. All across the world democracy and freedom of speech are in retreat. Wealth and income distributions are converging back to the shape they held in Victorian times. Most noticeable is the return of an inheritor class. A sizable group of people that earn more from intergenerational wealth transfers than can ever be earned by working a well paid job.

Some people such as Thomas Piketty argue that this reduction in political and economic equality is temporary and that the long term march is towards greater equality, not smaller. They are sorely mistaken. When the French revolted against their elite overlords in 1795, 1848, and 1871, they were mercilessly suppressed using “A wiff of grapeshot”. It was only after the demands of the first world war made the middle manager indispensable that the lower echelons of society managed to force real reforms. Now that that indispensability is fading the structures of power are likely to return to how they were or an even more unequal equilibrium.

Across the world governments are narrowing the set of individuals who share power and dismantling or subverting institutions they do not control directly. Deprived of their bargaining power the middle class lacks the heft to push back. While full on autocracy is not yet a reality for most of the world's population, growing polarization and a lack of broad centrist voting options is. Funny enough it is also that division that is preventing us from organizing to stop the processes that are about to take away the life we so cherish. If we could agree on what is happening we can change direction. Unfortunately both the path we are on and the actions to correct it are heavily contested. Whatever comes after the equality pulse, it is unlikely to include a middle class, if you are in it, enjoy the *equality pulse* while it lasts.
