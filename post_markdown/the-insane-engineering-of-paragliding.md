# The insane engineering of paragliding

Paragliding is bonkers. People are not birds, besides the difference in lineage and mode of reproduction we don't have their hollow bones, compressed brains or insane muscle to weight ratio. However a little bit of elevation and a lot of engineering can get us pretty damn close in terms of flightworthyness. For a long time this engineering involved a lot of combustion engine and copious amounts of plywood or aluminum. However, the advances in materials sciences in the late 20th and early 21st centuries enabled a sport where slightly brave individuals jump off a mountain carrying nothing but a few kilograms of plastic and, on a good day, give the vultures a run for their money.

## Paragliding statics

The basics of paragliding are simple. You hold a plastic bag above your head and jump off a mountain. Because the plastic bag slows your fall and you have chosen a nice place to jump off, you tend to be fine when you hit the ground. If you manage to find a bubble of air that is moving up while you are falling down, that is great, you get to stay up a little longer. Great success\!

Now for some jargon. A paraglider calls the plastic bags they hold over their head a **wing** (or canopy) and the thing they sit in a **harness**. **Lines** connect the **wing** and the **harness.** Wings are wider than they are long and have a front referred to as the **leading edge** and back referred to as the **trailing edge.** What is keeping you from hitting the ground really hard is the fact that the wing is so big that the downward friction it adds to that of your body balances out the gravity pulling you down at a relatively low speed. Typically between 1 m/s and 2 m/s. We call our rate of vertical drop **sink** and the amount of force the air exerts on your wing per square meter when you are not accelerating vertically (constant **sink**) is called **wing loading**. 

An example. When I jump off a mountain with my wing, harness and lunch-banana I weigh about 90kg. The advertised size of my wing is about 25m² (I never measured it) so naively the wing loading would be: 90kg / 25m² \= **3.6kg/m²**. This is comparable to the wingloading of most small birds. For comparison: a typical recreational sailplane loads their wings with about **40kg/m²,** an F35 fighter plane has a wing loading of about **500kg/m²**.

Wing-loading is a proxy for the relative strength of the forces keeping the plane in the air. It is also an indication of the amount of violence the wing inflicts upon the air and the air is prepared to inflict upon it. Higher wing loading means you are flying faster both forward and downward. This is nice when you are trying to win a competition or fly against the wind. But maybe not as nice in turbulent air.

Now let's be honest, 3.6kg/m² is only a ball park figure. The most important caveat is that, due to the shape of in flight, not all of the fabric is pointing down. A better approximation would be the projected size of my wing to the ground (22m²). But even then, some of the air is also pushing against my body, a little bit against the lines. Additionally the wing’s fabric, despite and in spite of its designer's best effort, is not uniformly loaded.

Is **3.6kg/m²** a lot? Clearly not if you are using metal or thick plates of wood but is it a lot for a piece of plastic? A simple experiment would be to take any square meter of plastic bag you have at home and load it with 4 kilograms of water and see what happens. Now either your feet are wet or you picked a rather heavy plastic bag. If you want to put some more effort in, try and find a plastic back that weighs less than 50 grams and will support the weight of your/someone's  5-year old son. Can’t find a bag that will do it? This is because the material used to make modern paragliding wings are **insane.**

**![Hmm... crispy skytex 27][image2]**  
If you look closely at the actual fabric you will see there are two easily discernible components. There is a **structural layer** which bears most of the forces usually made out of something like nylon 66\. Underneath the mesh there is the **coating layer**, made out of Polyurethane or Polyurethane–silicone hybrid. Together they form an incredible combination of flexibility, durability and airstopping power that goes a long way in closing the gap between man and bird.

These fabrics get names such as Skytex made by [Porcher Sport](https://www.porcher-ind.com/tissus-sportifs-en), DOKDO made by [Dominico Textile](https://sky.lentea.com/FileShare/soubory-ve-skladu/Download/DominicoTex.pdf) in or MJ32MF made by [Myungjin textile](http://www.mjtex.net). While the coating layers are fairly magic: they can get wet, warm, cold, freeze, stretch and take about 500 hours of UV exposure all without looking like a British tourist in Marseille, let's focus on the structural layer a bit more.

Although not quite as strong as the Aramids that are used for line (we will get to those in a bit), Nylon 66 is far more durable and flexible under a host of conditions. Skytex 27 (27g/m²) can handle about 40kg/m² that is about 10 times more than than our typical wing loading but modern wings are designed to handle at least 8G peak load. Conventional thinking in safety is that a healthy human body can handle about 7G of peak load without breaking so the equipment should at the very least outlast the pilot.

[![Fluffy tree, happy pilot][image3]](https://www.reddit.com/r/freeflight/comments/18uds3b/my_first_tree_landing_no_squirrel_was_hurt_during/)

A paragliding instructor once told me there are two types of pilots: “Pilots that have landed in a tree and pilots that have not yet landed had a tree landing.” Tree landings happen all the time and in case of emergency, a tree is the preferred object to suspend yourself and your glider in. According to [DHV](https://www.dhv.de/media/seiten/02_fliegen/Sicherheit/Unfaelle/Dateien/Unfallstatistik/Gleitschirm/Gleitschirm_Statistik_2012.pdf) (2012) most, but far from all, pilots landing in a tree escape unscathed. What is even more surprising is that many of their wings flew again. 

The most remarkable property of modern wing fabrics is not what happens to them under normal use. It is their resistance to damage.You can cut them with a knife, hang them in a tree, puncture them with a sharp rock, have an eagle scratch them in jealousy and often they will still fly. The structural layer will prevent many small and medium sized tears from spreading and the internal structure of the wing will maintain some semblance of its aerodynamic properties in most situations. Would any sensible pilot knowingly take off with a damaged wing… well no, but if it would happen by accident most likely the pilot would be able to land safely. The only downsides to modern wing materials seem to be that it is expensive and burns relatively easily. At about 100 euro per second.

The material paragliding lines are made out no less insane. The main components of modern paragliding lines are [UHMWPE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-molecular-weight_polyethylene) (branded Dyneema or Spectra) and [Aramids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramid) (branded as Kevlar, Technora, or Twaron). These are put together with some outer layers and coatings by [Edelrid](https://edelrid.com/eu-en/sport/activity/paragliding) or [Liron](https://www.liros.com/catalog/en/paragliding/) in Germany or [Cousin](https://www.cousin-group.com/en/category/rope/aero/paragliding/) in France, and then used by the wing manufacturers. UHMWPE and aramids have different properties and are used in different parts of the lines. Since UHMWPE don't suffer as much form bending, wrapping and tangling they are the main load bearing material near the harness. Aramids are more rigid and barely deform under load and are the main material used in the lines attached to the canopy. Both are several times stronger than steel. As a rule of thumb every single piece of line in a wing can carry the full weight of the pilot, but only just.

## Paragliding dynamics.

*Trigger warning: although technically correct, my simplified representation of flight physics might be upsetting to flight engineers.*

Most mountains in the world are not particularly steep. To avoid hitting the ground prematurely paragliders like to move forward. To help them do this the wing is better at holding air below it at the **leading edge** than at the **tailing edge**. This means almost all of the air that escapes from below the wing escapes in the back, giving you some nice forward trust. How much trust do you ask? Lets say my wing sinks at about 1.5m/s then my 22m2 of projected wing surface should collect 33 thousand liters of air (about 40kg). Every second, that 40kg of air is pushed/slips out the back. Even if it left at the same 1.5m/s it came in at, that would constitute about 45 Joules motive energy, giving me 45 Watts of trust. It actually gets compressed under the wing and leaves the back at closer to 4m/s relative to the wing. Since the relation between speed and energy is squared that means 320 Watt of thrust. Not quite a 50CC scooter engine but in the air this is nothing to be sniffed at.

If only we could go faster? From the previous explanation it is immediately clear that we can get more trust by increasing our sink speed. If we point our wing slightly down (this is referred to as increasing **angle of attack**) we reduce our downwards projected wing area. We have less vertical drag and start falling faster and gathering more air. This leaves the rear at a slightly higher speed relative to our wing due to stronger compression. This yields more trust and a higher top speed. 

I can’t keep pointing the wing ever further down to get more speed though. As my wing increases speed more the air will quickly serve me a violent reminder that I am only flying a plastic bag. When the pressure from the air pushing on the front of the wing exceeds that of the air pushing from below (at about 3.6kg/m²) the wing will lose its shape violently in what is called a **frontal collapse**. When it happens unexpectedly there is a moment of weightlessness in which the pilot can watch his life flash before his eyes. How did he get here? Is the ground too close or is it too far away? Why did he think he could cosplay as a bird using synthetic fabrics? This moment quickly passes however as the wing slows down and tries to reform under the new balance of forces.

![Pilot having an acute retrospective moment.][image4]

If we can't increase speed without increasing sink, and we can not increase max speed without risking a collapse, what have all of these smart people at glider design companies been doing all of these years? The answer to that is efficiency. If I fall with 90kgs at 1.5m/s I lose: 90Kg \* 9.8N/Kg \* 1.5m/s \= 1323 Joules of height energy per second . Meaning I have 1323 Watt that I convert into 320 Watt of thrust. Only 25% of the energy I lose falling down is actually turned into forward motion. Note I am skipping about 10 Million steps here, induced drag, profile drag, parasitic drag, turbulence, stalls  and several incarnations of the bernoulli effect.

## Paragliding safety

In the 1980s you only knew that a wing was ‘safe’ if a manufacturer told you so. Being honest, clear-eyed companies, none of them claimed their wings were safe but they did produce a homologisation standard under *Association des Constructeurs de Parapente Ultra Legers* (ACPUL). In 1987 the *Deutscher Hängegleiterverband*  (DHV) became an officially recognized sports body and Germans being Germans immediately published a set of rules described as the DHV standard. This did not sit well with the French who clearly needed some “dirigisme” of their own and in 1991 the French standardisation office (ANFOR) published a standard for paragliding manufacture and testing [S52-308](https://www.boutique.afnor.org/en-gb/standard/s52308/paraglider-qualification-of-paragliders-structural-resistance-tests/fa024177/76738)/[309](https://www.boutique.afnor.org/fr-fr/norme/s52309/parapente-qualification-des-parapentes-essais-en-vol/fa029667/79183). Then the *Schweizerischer Hängegleiterverband* (SHV) created a standard in Switzerland in 1992 and then Germans one-uped them by creating the *Lufttüchtigkeitsforderungen* (LTF) in 2003\. At this point it was fantastic fun to be in the business of paragliding equipment manufacturing or indeed a consumer trying to interpret what wing would be the best fit for you.

Thankfully, in 2005, the *European Committee for Standardization* (CEN) gave birth to EN 926-1, describing structural design, and EN 926-2 describing flight characteristics. Although EN-926-1 has remained unchanged since 2005 its sister document  926-2 has received periodic updates relating to new insights on flight safety. Because most of the manufacturers outside of Europe have also chosen to follow EN-926, almost every new wing sold in the world in 2025 received some sort of EN certification. Unfortunately both parts of the EN standard are commercial documents so I am not at liberty to share any links to them but if you are a nerd like me it's about 50 pages of pure joy. Most of the test reports themselves are public and are searchable at the testers themselves like the [DHV](%20https://service.dhv.de/db1/) or [Air Turquoise](https://para-test.com/reports?category=Glider_PG_&manufacturer=Advance&page=1). They give a decent impression of what is actually in the standards.

The basic idea of EN-926-2 is that every wing belongs in one of 4 categories, A, B, C and D. The descriptions of these classes, ranging from entry wings (A-Wings) with *"maximum passive safety”* to advanced wings (D-Wings) with *“potentially violent reactions”* gives you some basic feelings about what it is like to fly them.  
Then outside of these 4 there are two more broadly recognized classes of wings.  
Competition wings (Category Cross County or CCC) such as the *Ozone Enzo* and *Gin Boomerang* are compliant with EN 926-1 but are too fast and wild to even fit into the EN-D category. They are described separately by the World Airsports Federation (FAI) [documents that are public](https://fai.org/sites/default/files/civl/documents/sporting_code_s7_g_-_ccc_paragliders_requirements_2024.pdf).  
And then there are the uncertified wings you can buy in a dark alleyway that will do things the people at CEN could not envision or do not openly approve of. In practice that mainly means acrobatic flying with wings such as the U-T[urn Blackout](https://u-turn.de/en/produkt/blackout/). Or going really fast close to terrain with speed wings such as the [Ozone Dragonfly](https://flyozone.com/speed/products/gliders/dragonfly).

An important caveat to the EN system is that it focuses on how wings **passively** respond to incidents in **calm air.** What happens in turbulent air or when you mess with it in the wrong way is for you to find out when you hit turbulent air with it for the first time. Although no company is gaming this system at the low end of the spectrum (A/B wings) the design of D and CCC wings and the competitions that are flown with them has received [significant criticism](https://music.youtube.com/podcast/cZai_SjrRXo).

What are the differences between A and D wings? They look very similar in shape and are made out of roughly the same materials. And indeed the difference is **not what happens**, but **how violently it happens and who has to fix it**. 

One of the main enemies of paragliding designers is drag. The total drag coefficient (Cd) is an approximate model of how your surface area (in paragliding or often using the wing surface) relates to the drag you experience independent of speed. 

| “Vehicle” | Effective Cd |
| :---- | :---- |
| EN-A/B | \~0.9–1.1 |
| EN-C/D | \~0.7–0.9 |
| EN-CCC | \~0.6–0.8 |
| Pre 2000 wings | \~1.1–1.3 |
| Himalayan Griffon | \~0.2–0.3 |

Higher grade wings are simply more efficient, they turn a bigger fraction of the height energy they lose into forward motion and the wind slows them down less because they incur less drag at similar speeds. They are wider, sleeker and have a flatter vertical shape. They also have more cells and less internal rigidity.   
Drag can also be your friend. That “passive safety” A-wings are built around mean that drag is used to dampen out various motions of the wing that might be difficult for newer pilots to control. Higher drag also means slower landing and take-off. Over the years drag coefficients on all wings have come down significantly. In higher end wings this has been used to increase maximum speed, on A and B wings this has meant decreases in sink at typical speeds. Modern paragliders have nowhere near the efficiency that birds enjoy. Yet the quadratic nature of drag means the difference, on a good day, is less noticeable than you might think.
